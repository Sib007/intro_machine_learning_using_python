    "- A class attribute `translator`, which defaults to the freelancer's name.\n",
    "- 10 attributes provided at initialisation:\n",
    "    - `title`(a string) indicates the project's title (typically the title of the source document, or the overall title the translator gave the project if there's more than one document to be translated);\n",
    "    - `client` (a string) indicates the client who ordered the translation;\n",
    "    - `source` (a string) indicates the language of the source document (document to be translated);\n",
    "    - `target` (a string) indicates the language of the target document (translation);\n",
    "    - `words` (an integer) indicates the word count of the source document;\n",
    "    - `start`(a string) indicates the project's start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD);\n",
    "    - `deadline`(a string) indicates the project's deadline in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD);\n",
    "    - `price` (an integer) indicates the total price invoiced to the client (excl. VAT);\n",
    "    - `tm` (a boolean) indicates whether or not a translation memory is available for this project;\n",
    "    - `domain` (a string) indicates the overall domain to which the project belongs.\n",
    "- 4 computed attributes:\n",
    "    - `daysleft`, which calculates the number of days left until the project deadline by subtracting the current date from the deadline;\n",
    "    - `length`, which calculates the total number of days allotted for the project by subtracting the start date from the deadline;\n",
    "    - `rate`, which calculates the word rate for the project by dividing the total price by the word count in the source document;\n",
    "    - `efficiency`, which calculates how many words the translator needs to translate per day to meet the deadline."
